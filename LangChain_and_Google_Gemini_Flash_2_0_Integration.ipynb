The *`-q`* flag ensures that the installation runs quietly, reducing unnecessary output, and the *`-U`* flag updates the package to the latest version if it's already installed. Together, these commands prepare the environment for building AI applications that leverage both LangChain’s workflow management and Google’s AI capabilities.**"

              "AIMessage(content='Hi Saim Hassan! It\\'s great to talk to you. Let\\'s break down humanoid robotics in a way that\\'s easy to understand.\\n\\n**Okay, so what are Humanoid Robots?**\\n\\nImagine a robot that looks and acts (at least somewhat) like a human. That\\'s essentially what a humanoid robot is. They\\'re designed to have:\\n\\n* **A Head:** Often with sensors that act like eyes and ears (cameras, microphones).\\n* **A Torso:** The main body part that houses the robot\\'s \"brain\" (computer) and other components.\\n* **Arms and Hands:** Designed for manipulation and interaction with the world.\\n* **Legs and Feet:** For walking, balancing, and moving around.\\n\\n**Why Build Robots That Look Like Us?**\\n\\nThere are a few key reasons:\\n\\n* **Working in Human Environments:** Humanoid robots are designed to fit into spaces built for humans. They can use tools, climb stairs, and navigate buildings without needing major modifications to the surroundings.\\n* **Human-Robot Interaction:** It\\'s often easier for us to interact with something that resembles us. We might find it more natural to communicate and collaborate with a robot that has a face and limbs.\\n* **Research and Understanding:** Building humanoid robots helps scientists better understand how the human body works, especially in areas like balance, movement, and perception.\\n* **Entertainment and Inspiration:** Humanoid robots can be captivating and inspire us about the possibilities of technology. Think of robots in movies and TV shows!\\n\\n**What Can They Do?**\\n\\nThe capabilities of humanoid robots vary greatly, but here are some common tasks they can perform:\\n\\n* **Walking and Balancing:** This is a HUGE challenge, and researchers are constantly improving it.\\n* **Object Manipulation:** Picking up, moving, and using tools.\\n* **Speech Recognition and Synthesis:** Understanding and responding to spoken commands.\\n* **Facial Recognition and Expression:** Identifying people and conveying basic emotions.\\n* **Data Collection:** Using sensors to gather information about their environment.\\n* **Assisting with Tasks:** In some cases, they can help with tasks in factories, hospitals, and even homes.\\n\\n**Where Are They Used?**\\n\\nHumanoid robots are being explored in various fields:\\n\\n* **Research Labs:** For studying robotics, AI, and human movement.\\n* **Manufacturing:** Helping with assembly and other tasks.\\n* **Healthcare:** Assisting patients and healthcare professionals.\\n* **Education:** Teaching kids about robotics and STEM.\\n* **Entertainment:** Performing shows and interacting with audiences.\\n* **Exploration:** Potentially being used in dangerous or remote environments.\\n\\n**Challenges and Future**\\n\\nBuilding humanoid robots is incredibly complex. Some of the biggest challenges include:\\n\\n* **Power:** Making them energy-efficient and able to operate for long periods.\\n* **Balance and Movement:** Creating smooth and stable locomotion.\\n* **Artificial Intelligence:** Giving them the ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions.\\n* **Cost:** Making them more affordable and accessible.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the field of humanoid robotics is rapidly advancing. We can expect to see more sophisticated and capable robots in the future, playing an increasingly important role in our lives.\\n\\n**In a Nutshell:**\\n\\nHumanoid robots are robots designed to look and act like humans. They are being developed for a variety of purposes, from research to assistance to entertainment. While there are still many challenges to overcome, they represent a fascinating and rapidly evolving area of technology.\\n\\nI hope this explanation is helpful, Saim! Do you have any other questions about humanoid robotics or anything else? I\\'m happy to help!\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': [{'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}]}, id='run-49fa3b29-3b04-48c4-957a-6489af14b3df-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 761, 'total_tokens': 781, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
